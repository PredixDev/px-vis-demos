# px-vis-demos

## Overview

`Px-vis-demos` is a set of demos that show more advanced examples of what can be done with the vis framework and vis charts.

The demos are hosted on the predix-ui.com website. The currently available demos are:

### Dynamic chart generator

https://www.predix-ui.com/px-vis-demos/px-vis-demos/dynamic_add.html

This demo can dynamically create different types of chart with different options and different dynamically generated datasets. The rendering of the charts is measured and displayed in the console so that it is possible to benchmark the impact of various different options on the chart.

### Crosshair demo

https://www.predix-ui.com/px-vis-demos/px-vis-demos/crosshair.html

This demo illustrates the "crosshair" feature which aims at highlighting corresponding points across several charts. When hovering over a first chart the related timestamps of the points detected are passed to the other charts which will highlight points having the same timestamp.
